# First_Project
First Python Project (plots data)

This is my first attempt at a Python project for data analysis of positional data.
It takes a csv file (formatted from another application) and extarcts teh data required to create a polar plot in MatPlotLib.
It allows you to choose teh targets you want plotted and select a colour for each plot.

Some work to do but it's functional.
